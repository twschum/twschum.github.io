        	<h4>EndocZ Returns (29 Apr)</h4>
        	<p>After a while down due to various reasons, we are excited to announce that the server is back and better than ever!  Now running on a linux flavor designed to run a Minecraft server, our machine is lean, mean, and hungry for action.
        	<br>This change means a more stable and smooth experience for everyone involved.  Current server is on Minecraft v1.7.10 and will remain so for the forseeable future.	</p>
        	<p>Server Address:<br><strong>endoc.no-ip.org</strong></p>
        
			<h4>Twilight Forest Mod added! (and a newer Bibliocraft, v1.5.5) (18 May('14))</h4>
			<p>Finally a use for that shiny new suit of emerallium (you're gonna need it), or incentive to make one after toasting to a crisp between the jaws of a hydra.  Jump on in! </p>
			
			<h4>NPCs Mod added! (26 April)</h4>
			<p>We always move carefully when considering a mod, wanting to ensure it is quality work and fits well with our established theme/feel of the server.  This is a great mod that adds an incredibly customizable array of NPC creation tools.  This allows for a castle full of guards and merchants (fully interactable!), as well as bandits and others inhabiting the world, making everything in general a lot livelier.  Currently, only admins can create/modify NPCs.  </p>
		
			<h4>New version of BiblioCraft <b>v1.5.1</b> (27 October)</h4>
			<p>We are now on a new version of BiblioCraft. It adds cool new things!  Check it out on the EndocZ mod page.</p>
		
			<h4>Server Address Change (9 October)</h4>
			<p>The old IP address for the server is no longer valid, but this new and improved address will remain constant, and is a whole lot easier to remember.  Happy crafting ~Tim</p>
			<p>New address:<br><strong>endoc.no-ip.biz</strong></p>
			
			<h4>Endoc is on 1.6 and Modded! (18 August)</h4>
			<p>Endoc is currently running on Minecraft 1.6 and modded via Forge with our own EndocZ, Bibliocraft, and Dragon Mounts.  We have also put a lot of work into the texture pack to make everything work together and look awesome.  You can download everything from the EndocZ tab
			<p>The "Horses Update" number 1.6 is out and Endoc is updated and modded as well. Texturepack is updated and available.  Check out the page to find out all about the EndocZ mod.</p>
            <p>Phase II of EndocZ has been launched, adding tameable, ridable, breedable dragons! (Aug 15)</p>
			<p>Phase III of EndocZ has been launched, adding cool new blocks (like colored stone brick), and a new endgame material (Emerallium)!  Details to follow in an updated crafting guide. (Oct 15)</p>
            
        
		<h4>Rules:</h4>

	    <p> Be respectful.<br> No griefing.<br> Have fun!
            </p>              
            <h4>Server Settings:</h4>
        
            <p>
              Currently: (as of Nov 18)<br> Difficulty set to NORMAL<br>Gamemode on SURVIVAL
			</p>
			
	    <h4>Backup Schedule:</h4>
	    <p>Server runs a daily backup at 5:00AM with no ingame warning.  This is quick, and server is running again within 2 minutes.  Because of the way it works, however, I would recommend not building anything about 15 minutes prior to the scheduled backup.  Weekly backup and restart occurs at 5:30AM on Sundays, and this backup takes several minutes.</p>
